### FinTech application to better communicate future recalls of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicine for Consumers

## Background

Every year, there are thousands of recalls issued by the Federal Drug Administration. A drug recall occurs when a prescription or over-the-counter medicine is removed from the market because it is found to be either defective or potentially harmful. Sometimes, the makers of the drug will discover a problem with their drug and voluntarily recall it. Other times, the FDA will request that the medicine be recalled after receiving reports of problems from the public (WebMD 2022).

Medicine is rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness before becoming available to the consumer. In the U.S., the FDA makes sure that this happens. Once on the market, the FDA, along with the makers of prescription drugs, continue to monitor the medicine for any unforeseen problems (WebMD 2022)!
